    WEBSITE is called online library located in RWANDA IN Kigali
    The National Library of Rwanda Inkoranyabitabo in Kinyarwanda was founded in 1989 by the presidential order no 132/06 of March the 10th 1989 as a direction in Ministry of High Education and Research. It is located in the city of Kigali. It has a printed and digital collections.
    Kigali Public Library was opened in 2012 by the Kigali-Virunga Rotary Club. It is currently running on a public-private partnership with the Ministry of Education.
It was the first of its kind to open in Rwanda. However,  bookstores like Ikirezi and Librairie Caritas have been operating before the library opened.
If you love reading and it’s your first time hearing about the Kigali Public Library, brace yourself. I often go there looking for a specific book and come home with 3 I didn’t even know existed (40,000+ books can be quite the distraction!). 

The library has something for everyone. If you love cozy, quiet spaces, there’s plenty. If you need to be productive, make use of the study areas. And if you love food, great coffee, and chilling with friends, Shokola is absolutely one of the best restaurants in Kigali.

If you were waiting for a sign, this is it. Visit and share your experience at the Kigali Public Library because I, for one, think this library has everything and is bringing positive impacts to Rwanda as a whole.
